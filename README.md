# Codename Indigo

![Gameplay Preview](preview.gif)

## What is This?
The first project created through an open development collaboration among [Game Dev League](https://discordapp.com/invite/gamedev) members over the month of April.

## About the game
It will be a 2d top down adventure game where the player must overcome challenges on a series of floors as they climb the Ascension Tower. Primary gameplay consists of exploration, dialogue interaction and simple puzzle solving.

The original premise is:
> Climb the Ascension Tower, a mighty place of power, with your childhood friend. Each floor will challenge you with a unique puzzle. How far will you go to fulfill your dream?

## Process

The direction of the game is decided by a democratic process among the members. Discussion will be in threaded form via [issues](https://github.com/GDL-Collaborators/indigo/issues).

In the case of community votes the reactions will be tallied as total :+1:s minus :-1:s. The project lead will cast only tie breaking votes.
